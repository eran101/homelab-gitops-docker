# 🏡 Home Lab GitOps

This repository contains the **infrastructure-as-code (IaC)** configuration for my **home lab**, following a **GitOps** approach using **Docker** and **Terraform**.

All services are defined and managed through version-controlled code to ensure reproducible, consistent, and automated deployments.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 **GitOps workflow** – Infrastructure updates via Git commits
- 🐳 **Docker-based services** – Containers provisioned and managed through Terraform
- ⚙️ **Infrastructure as Code** – Declarative setup using Terraform
- 🧪 **Home lab focused** – Built for experimentation, learning, and local service orchestration

## 📦 Stack

- **Terraform** – Infrastructure provisioning
- **Docker** – Container runtime
- **GitHub** – Version control and source of truth
